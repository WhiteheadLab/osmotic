To-do:
======
1. re-do 3 assemblies:
    - F. heteroclitus (2 separate populations)
    - F. diaphanus FW 1 is actually a heteroclitus (remove this sample from the F. diaphanus assembly)
    - F. sciadicus BW 2 is actually a chrysotus (remove this sample from the F. sciadicus assembly)
2. What proportion of contigs with annotations have counts vs. unannotated counts?
3. Of the genes with annotations, what are the significance values compare with the mapping DE method?
