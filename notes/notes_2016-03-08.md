MDPL = Maryland point locale = F. heteroclitus heteroclitus = brackish water (BW) native
MDPP = Maryland piscatawe park (northern) = F. heteroclitus macrolepidotus = more similar to the northern populations of killifish = FW native

Are assemblies working?
1. split F. heteroclitus

diagnosis:
2. CRB vs. recip?
3. CD-hit
4. blast assembled transcriptome against itself

fix:
5. look at Trinity --advanced-usage to collapse isoforms
