## Project status update:

Mapping:

* Noah got DE results, Andrew has these

De novo:

* have dammit annotations: `/home/ljcohen/osmotic_dammit_annotations`
* have BUSCO scores for metazoan


To-do:

* get transrate scores
* use rapclust to collapse orthologous contigs
* get read numbers from trimmomatic output
* blat or shmlast against reference
* maybe re-do assemblies
* look at similarity between dammit output and gene models
* consolidate files on farm cluster - there are too many directories and it is confusing
