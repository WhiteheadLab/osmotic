[2017-01-23 02:53:17.001] [jointLog] [info] Counted 10358138 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-01-23 02:53:17.024] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0012775% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
