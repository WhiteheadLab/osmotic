==================
Observed 16410580 total fragments (16410580 in most recent round)

[2017-01-23 02:32:19.996] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000347337% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
