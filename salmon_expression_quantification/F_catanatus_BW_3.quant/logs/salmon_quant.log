[2017-01-23 02:38:39.216] [jointLog] [info] Counted 13609678 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-01-23 02:38:39.287] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00689394% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
