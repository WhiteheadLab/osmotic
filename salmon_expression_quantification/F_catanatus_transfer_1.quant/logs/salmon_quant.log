==================
Observed 29907018 total fragments (29907018 in most recent round)

[2017-01-23 03:07:39.313] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00030762% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
