[2017-01-23 03:16:24.804] [jointLog] [info] Counted 15247894 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-01-23 03:16:24.842] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000421981% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
