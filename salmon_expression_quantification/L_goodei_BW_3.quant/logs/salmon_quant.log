Observed 13341204 total fragments (13341204 in most recent round)

[2017-01-21 20:10:24.449] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00107187% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
